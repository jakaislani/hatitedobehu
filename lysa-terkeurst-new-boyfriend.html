Though the writer hasn't yet labeled her relationship with the new man she recently introduced to her followers on Instagram, it seems like she's dating and in love with him. Everything Lysa TerKeurst has written about him makes it seem like he's her new boyfriend.</strong></p><p><strong>Lysa TerKeurst</strong> is best known as the founder of Proverbs 31 Ministries and as an <a href=#><strong>author</strong></a> of Christian non-fiction. She has penned more than a dozen books including Uninvited: Living Loved When You Feel Less Than, Left Out, and Lonely and Forgiving What You Can't Forget, It’s Not Supposed to Be This Way, Unglued: Making Wise Choices in the Midst of Raw Emotions, and The Best Yes: Making Wise Decisions in the Midst of Endless Demands.</p><p>Lately, she seems to be writing captions about love and life and hope and happiness for her new love. She got divorced about in 2022 and was heartbroken about it for a long time. Now, it looks like she got someone who is mending her heart for her. She seems to be in love with her new boyfriend. It looks that way from the pictures she has shared on Instagram. Let's learn everything there is to know about Lysa TerKeurst and her new boyfriend!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>relationship status</a>&nbsp;</strong>of <a href=#><strong>Beth Holloway</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Spider-Punk</strong></a>.</p><h2>Does Lysa TerKeurst Have a New Boyfriend? Who is She Dating?</h2><p>If <strong>Lysa TerKeurst</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lysaterkeurst</a>) thought that she would never find love again after she got divorced from her husband of almost 29 years in 2022, how wrong she was! Because she seems to have gotten himself a new boyfriend who makes her much happier than her ex-husband ever made her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/lysa-terkeurst-pic1.jpg alt="Lysa TerKeurst seems to have been dating a new boyfriend. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lysa TerKeurst seems to have been dating a new boyfriend.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Relevant Magazine</strong></p><p>It was a devastating time for Lysa when she was forced to end her marriage with <strong>Art TerKeurst</strong> and get separated from him forever after he continued to remain unfaithful. Their marriage was already on the brink of death and they had already split up in 2017 but the writer had some hopes that somehow they would make it through when they renewed their vows a year later. But after Art made no effort and she found that "it's hard to face a future that looks nothing like what I desperately and constantly prayed it would look like," their relationship came to an end for good in 2022.</p><p>Now, a year and a half later, Lysa TerKeurst seems to have found a future that she wanted and prayed for. She seems to have gotten a second chance at love with a new man. And she wants to share with the world that she has found love again. So, she posted on Instagram a picture of herself smiling away to glory with her new boyfriend CA. In that picture of them together walking hand-in-hand, she wrote a caption "<a href=# rel=noopener>a new chapter</a>."</p><p>Though Lysa hasn't really labeled the new man her new boyfriend, she is most likely dating him. From their pictures, it looks as though she's so in love so, it has to be someone she's in a romantic relationship with. She has not shared much about him and refers to him as "CA" maybe because she wants to protect his privacy but she has posted a video of pictures and clips of them together, and the way she admires him and looks at him, she's definitely in love with him.</p><h2>Lysa TerKeurst Seems to Be in Love With Her New Boyfriend!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/lysa-terkeurst-pic2.jpg alt="Lysa TerKeurst seems to be in love with her new man. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lysa TerKeurst seems to be in love with her new man.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>Lysa TerKeurst</strong> seems happier than ever with her new boyfriend.

But I am so grateful that when everything else feels so uncertain, the goodness and kindness of God is something we can count on.</strong></p><p>Lysa TerKeurst hasn't revealed exactly when she started dating her new boyfriend but since some of the clips feature snow and cold weather, her followers speculate that she has been in love with her new man for a while. She posted a series of clips of him and her absolutely beaming on an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram reel</a> and captioned it,</p><p><strong>The hard parts of our story aren’t the end of our story.
