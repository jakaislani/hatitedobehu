The first image in the post shows him hiding his face under a hoodie while standing on a sidewalk.</p><p class=dh>In the following image, Julez’s green eyes and curly hair emerge from the hoodie as he seems to wait somewhere indoors. The next snapshot is a mirror selfie taken with the flash on.</p><p class=dh>Another selfie shows Julez in the bathroom as he checks his braided hair out in the mirror and shares his new look with his fans and followers. He seems to be very satisfied with his new hairstyle, and his friends showed him support in the comments section of the post.</p><p class=dh>“Big bro, go crazy!” somebody<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEewvukD7Sn/> wrote</a>. “Rockstar,” another user <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEewvukD7Sn/>wrote</a>, adding an electric guitar emoji. “Yes,” <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEewvukD7Sn/>approved</a> a third user, adding a fire emoji.
