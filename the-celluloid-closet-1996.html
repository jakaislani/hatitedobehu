The chat with <a href=#>Gore Vidal</a> has already become famous. He recalls how he was hired by director <a href=#>William Wyler</a> to do rewrites on “Ben-Hur.” One of the film's problems was that there was no plausible explanation for the hatred between the characters played by <a href=#>Charlton Heston</a> and <a href=#>Stephen Boyd</a>. Vidal's suggestion: They were lovers when they were teenagers, but now Ben-Hur (Heston) denies that time, and Boyd is resentful. Wyler agreed that would provide the motivation for a key scene, but decided to tell only Boyd, not Heston, who “wouldn't be able to handle it.”The film shows the scene, which plays with an amusing subtext.</p><p>Sometimes directors deleted scenes with gay themes because of studio or censorship pressure. <a href=#>Tony Curtis</a> is droll as he recalls a scene with <a href=#>Laurence Olivier</a> in Stanley Kubrick's “<a href=#>Spartacus</a>,” where the two men flirted in a hot bath. (The scene was restored when the movie was re-released in 1991.) Is it because we know stars were gay that their scenes play differently this time around? There's a scene from “Pillow Talk” in which <a href=#>Rock Hudson</a> plays a straight man pretending to be gay in order to avoid an entanglement with <a href=#>Doris Day</a>. Does Hudson seem privately amused by the twist? It looks that way (and Mark Rappaport's “Rock Hudson's Home Movies” finds scenes all through Hudson's career where he seems aware of additional levels of possibilities).</p><p>“The Celluloid Closet” was directed by <a href=#>Rob Epstein</a> and <a href=#>Jeffrey Friedman</a>, who won Oscars for their two previous gay-themed docs, “The Life of Harvey Milk” and “Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt”; their track record encourages their interview subjects to open up. Playwright and actor <a href=#>Harvey Fierstein</a> recalls that when he was young he always liked the “sissies” in the movies, and Tomlin, narrating a montage that shows how very many sissies there were (from <a href=#>Peter Lorre</a> to <a href=#>Anthony Perkins</a>), says sissies made the other characters seem “more manly or more womanly, by filling the space in between.” “The Celluloid Closet” surveys movies from the earliest times to the present, showing characters who were gay even though the movies pretended not to know (<a href=#>Marlene Dietrich</a> in trousers in the 1930 film “Morocco,” for example, or a musical number named “Ain't There Anyone Here for Love?” in 1953's “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” in which <a href=#>Jane Russell</a> dances smolderingly through a gym where the body-builders studiously ignore her). It gives full due to the ground-breaking 1970 movie “The Boys in the Band” and such recent films as “<a href=#>Philadelphia</a>.” I learn from Brandon Judell, a film critic on the Internet, that the filmmakers weren't able to include one planned sequence because of legal objections. They wanted to show scenes from biopics that turned gays into straights, but couldn't get the rights. Richard Burton's estate refused the rights to show scenes from “Alexander the Great.” Goldwyn wouldn't license clips from “Hans Christian Andersen” (Epstein says “somehow they got the idea we were outing <a href=#>Danny Kaye</a> as opposed to Hans Christian Andersen”). Lawyers stepped in at the possibility that the film would identify <a href=#>Cole Porter</a> as homosexual (!). And Charlton Heston refused permission to use scenes from “The Agony and the Ecstasy” (“because he'd done a lot of research for his role and he assured us that Michelangelo was not homosexual”). And I suppose Ben-Hur wasn't, either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk5q5rcHLqKCdZZOhvLSx02ZocnFm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./antonio-garcia-villaran-net-worth-287974.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antonio Garca-Villarn Net Worth">&larr;
