The film is bogged down with more action-figure-friendly supporting characters—oh yeah, "Arrow" star Stephen Amell plays hockey-mask-wielding hero Casey Jones—than even the most over-stuffed superhero movie. The plot is essentially lifted from several other Ninja Turtles-related stories. The film is pre-visualized-to-death with its ugly-looking CG protagonists, who still look like the California Raisins' olive-skinned, Mini-Cooper-sized cousins.</description></item><item><title>Why Gwyneth Paltrow is Getting Sued for a 2016 Ski Accident</title><link>/gwyneth-paltrow-ski-accident-and-lawsuit.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gwyneth-paltrow-ski-accident-and-lawsuit.html</guid><description>This much is clear: Actor Gwyneth Paltrow was involved in a skiing accident with retired optometrist Terry Sanderson at the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, on February 26, 2016.
