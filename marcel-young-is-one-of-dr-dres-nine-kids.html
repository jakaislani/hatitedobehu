He keeps most of his life private, so there is very little information about him on the Internet.</p><p>In fact, Marcel has only <a href=#>made headlines</a> because of two things: his appearance in a drama titled “Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge, and Michel’le” in 2016 and his parent’s violent relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Marcel keeps most of his life private. However, some information about him has been gleaned from interviews and some social media posts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Marcel-Young-1-1.jpg><p>Marcel was born in 1991 when Michel’le was still actively striving to be a musician. She <a href=#>met</a> Dr Dre because of their interest in music.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the sole producer of the label she was signed to, and their work together led to them getting closer and eventually intimate. Sadly, her relationship with Dr Dre slowly unraveled after he was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Dre was not yet as big as he is now career-wise and had been completely focused on making a name for himself. Thus he was not ready to fulfill his responsibilities as a father.</p><p>Eventually, she and Dr Dre went their separate ways; their son had been five. Despite their separation and the bad blood between his parents, Marcel has remained close to them and his siblings.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Really_Happened_Between_His_Parents></span>What Really Happened Between His Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michel’le and Dr Dre had a tumultuous relationship while they were together. It was not just about Dr Dre being unavailable physically, as Michel’le seemed to understand that part. It had more to do with Dr Dre being <a href=#>physically abusive</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michelle.jpg><p>She once claimed that as a person in showbiz, not having a child was the best option if success was the goal. This may be a shocking take to some, but when it comes to Michel’le, it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>When her son was a fetus growing within her, she had no idea. By the time she found out, he was already six months old, and she was in the middle of the Hammer tour.&nbsp;</p><p>Being pregnant left her no choice but to suspend her plans to <a href=#>perform</a> on the tour, which had two months to go. Michel’le had to return home to deliver her baby before continuing the tour.&nbsp;</p><p>She eventually stepped away from music and settled down as a housewife and mother. However, Dr Dre allegedly had a habit of hitting her, so there was no joy in their home.&nbsp;</p><p>Michel’le <a href=#>said </a>about the sordid experience: “When you’re living in it, you can’t see it,” Michel’le. But I couldn’t believe that I was really living like that, and it really resonated with me. Never did I wake up and ask Dre., ‘Why did you hit me?'”</p><p>Dr Dre allegedly threatened to sue her for making him look like a woman beater for what she said, but there are no records of him doing so.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marcel_Youngs_Siblings></span>Marcel Young’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite Michel’le’s claims that Dr Dre used her face as a punching bag one too many times, she praised him for being a good father.&nbsp;</p><p>Including Marcel, the rapper has <a href=#>nine kids</a> with different women, the first being the one he had while he was still just a high school kid. His kids include:&nbsp;</p><li>Curtis Young</li><li>LaTanya Young</li><li>Tyra Young</li><li>LaToya Young</li><li>Ashley Young</li><li>Andre R Young Jr</li><li>Marcel Young</li><li>Truice Young</li><li>Truly Young</li><p>Unfortunately, Dr Dre <a href=#>lost his son </a>Andre in 2008. The boy was 20 at the time and was found dead in his California home around 10:30 am on August 23 by his mom, Jenita Porter.&nbsp;</p><p>She quickly called for help but the paramedics that came were unable to resuscitate him and pronounced him dead at the scene. Months later, it was revealed that Andre’s death was an <a href=#>accident</a> caused by morphine and heroin intoxication.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqK%2Bwp6jZrGfqruoecisZKimlWK8p3nDq2SdqpWoeq%2B1zZ5kpKGUqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sheldon-harnick-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheldon Harnick Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
